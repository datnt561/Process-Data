Bag	POS	4	this be a pretty decent product . more room than I expect , but the shoulder strap really need to go . there be absolutely nothing special about it . it could use some sort of padding on it too . the bag fit my Canon EOS ix Lite 2 lens , a flash , the owner 's manual , 5 roll of film , and I have still get room .
Bag	POS	4	what a great bag ! I have a few quibble ; as note , the inside pocket be a bit tight . the zipper tab do not seem to match the heft of the zipper . the exterior pocket flap should be a bit wider\/broader to cover the pocket and the gatemouth design seem to balk if you stuff the bag . all minor . well construct overall and every bit worth the price . a reasonably lightweight bag that hold a decent amount - of course , you 'll cram more into it than you can comfortably carry . because it be a medium\/long bag you have to balance the load - otherwise it dip - and why no shoulder pad ? I personally would not recommend the recip see w\/blade in the bag . I once trip and land on a nylon bag w \/ a jigsaw - blade in thigh - ouch ! no more . blade off all saw -lrb- except circular -rrb- and hard case for transport . I like this bag a lot .
Bag	POS	4	the picture in the catalog make the product appear bigger than it be actual size . if you think the one you want be big enough ... go bigger ! I wish I have . Quality be good .
Bag	NEG	2	look like a good product , but be clearly use and the belt be worn so I return it . Amazon will not let you exchange this product , so I order another . if it be use as well , I 'll be dissapoint . so far I have order 3 powertool on Amazon and all have be clearly use , and some missing part . I be give they one last shot . beware .
Bag	POS	5	I buy this for my camcorder awhile back and it be a pretty decent bag . it be sturdy and it hold everything I need . it be decent bag if you travel light however if you be look for a bag that fit all you camcorder equipment -lrb- if you intend use for the bag be a carry case -rrb- then you be better off get something else .
Bag	NEG	2	I have recently purchase numerous Bosch tool from Amazon\/Tool Crib and I have be a life-long Bosch fan . however , I have to say that this be the very first time I have be let down by one of they product . I guess I just get a rare `` lemon '' . immediately on use it , I have problem with the `` lock-on button '' . either it would not keep the machine running , or when it do engage I could then not stop it ! it work sporadically , but usually not until I have try to disengage or engage it several time . then , after just 15 minute use sand some deck timber , a loud clatter develop . sound like a bearing problem ? this do not seem to unduly affect performance , and since I purchase the unit for this specific job , I carry on for a while . then , the rear belt wheel start to slip or disengage , like a slip clutch . the work I be do be not unduly difficult and for a period of time , the work be go like a dream , much as I be use to with Bosch tool . so finally , I just give up-extremely disappoint that I could not finish the job at hand . I have return it and I will get the 1276dv instead .
Bag	POS	5	I want to buy something for my Canon PowerShot g3 and I find it . maybe the bag be a little bit small , but it be not that bad . it can contain the camera itself , 2-3 compactflash card and spare battery . I do not think you can find a better bag for the price .
Bag	NEU	3	well ... it look bigger in the picture . be Bosch I would have expect the material to be a little more durable . it do catch 60 to 70 percent of the sawdust as advertised but you have to empty the bag often . I feel it be not worth what I pay -lrb- $ 12 and change -rrb- . six or seven dollar would be a good price for this item .
Bag	POS	4	a pleasure to use . relatively quiet . Belt track flawlessly . adequate power . can clamp upside down in a wood worker 's bench vice to use as a stationary sander . dust collector work well and be usually not in the way . Wish it come with it be own case . all in all I be very happy with the purchase .
Bag	POS	5	all my friend could say be `` be do you get that Amazon.com bag ? '' . it be very durable and a great gift idea . what else will Amazon.com sell ? thanks Amazon.com .
Bag	POS	5	we use this product in a cabinet shop and it hold up well to the daily use . Easy to use and maintain well .
Bag	POS	5	at first glance , I do not think my 20 foot 4 gauge jumper cable would even fit into this bag . but they fit without much effort and there be still room for a few thing to fit in the bag . I also fit a 20 foot extension cord in addition to the jumper cable . I also put some temporary tire repair item in there as well , all fit fine . do not take up much space and can hold quite a lot . I be satisfied with this purchase .
Bag	POS	4	a very nice little bag . hold my sharp Viewcam , extra tape , and cord . very compact and lot of cushiony foam . reccommend for small to mid-size camera or camcorder and all you little accessory . great price !
Bag	POS	4	it be perfect for my Sony comcorder , plus two or four tape , extra batery , and even ac adapter . only annoying thing be that it make this weird `` gi , gi , gi , gi . '' sound -lrb- plastic glide -rrb- when carry it around . the strap be decent , not extremely comfortable , many improvment can be make . it be just the right size , and I think it be a good buy .
Bag	NEU	3	well , actually , it be kind of ugly . it have this weird gray piping around it that -- while you can see it in the picture -- be actually much more pronounced than that , and really ugly .  safety ? I do not think so . too small . aesthetic ? Uh , no. . I think I be go to take a black magic marker to it . secondly , the internal pouch for the laptop be rather small -- my IBM 460 barely squeeze in it at all . really have to work to get it in or out . Third , it be floppy . maybe that be the way a messenger bag have to be , but , well it be a little more floppy than I want .  finally , it be expensive . I mean $ 40 ! I want something really great for that kind of money .  so , be there anything good ? sure . it be get lot of usefull little pouch and pocket , which be how I like to organize my world . it do slap comfortably across my back and stick where I want it while ride . so , I do not think it be the organizional foundation upon which I will find the rest of my life , but it be ok .
Bag	POS	5	like one reviewer state , this bag be more like a tool box than a tool bag . I have use mine to carry all sort of different gear and tool , quickly throw whatever I need for the job into the bag , hook on the shoulder strap , and head out the door . I work in a environment where I be able to have a permanent `` tool cage '' and similar rolling case to store my tool in the shop , but I often need to grab a few tool and head off to a job somewhere . this be where these bag come in . I fill they with whatever I need , and off i go . I know this sound like a task for any old bag , but these tough bag withstand the weight and beating of heavy use without flinching . I know one reviewer complain about not be able to stand up he drill , but if that be a concern to I , I would transport they in the original DeWalt hard plastic case . I be usually in such a hurry that I need something big and reliable to throw my stuff in but not so big that I can not move it . I also own one of the smaller version of this bag , the DeWalt d6050 -lrb- asin b0006jkusw -rrb- that I use for a permanent collection of basic hand tool I keep in it at all time . give the minimal price difference between the two , I could have opt for another d6100 , but the smaller model prevent I from overload it to the point where I would break before the bag ! this be a great bag for any on-the-go pro !
Bag	POS	4	it be smaller than I imagine , look at the pic , compare size to the size of the cable clamp . the zipper open it up all the way like a clam shell . it would be better if only the top open make it easier to put the cable in and out . the center divider be attach only at the bottom and have a mesh zipper pocket , and several small pocket well suit for screwdriver , which I do not need to keep with my jumper cable . just like the extension cord bag , the handle be thin and floppy compare to the bag .
Bag	POS	5	I like this bag . I have 3 of they , and love they all . strong quality . its only weak point seem to be where in connect to the shoulder strap . Seem a little weak , but have not bust yet . if it be to break , it would still be a great functional bag though .
Bag	NEG	1	this dust bag be so filmy I be afraid to handle it fear I might tear it . for 12 buck you think Bosch would spend a little more on the material . it be a insult to the ts4000 saw . shame !
Bag	POS	4	good size and shape . Easy to handle and do a much better job than my old heavy craftsman 4 '' x 21 '' po . I especially like the flat top ; even without the accessory frame you can turn this upside down and use it briefly as a bench-type sander . handle be position well for one-hand control from the back , or extra control or pressure add from the front . dust pickup be good with coarser grit belt , but diminish rapidly as you run finer and finer grits . I have the same problem as several other reviewer . the graphite platen pad on this new Bosch last only about 20 minute before self-destruct . it deposit lump of graphite -lrb- or the backing pad -rrb- on the wheel that make they bounce and shudder until I be able to scrape and clean they off . I find it hard to believe that Bosch can ignore such a well document and obvious flaw in they design . this have get to be fix in future version .
Bag	POS	5	I be shop for the Boss Tool Roll , and come across this item which let I store my always-tangled jumper cable in my truck in a tidy little container . make from very heavy-duty nylon , this have adequate room to handle a set of heavy-duty 16 ' jumper cable . the zipper be tough enough to handle the load . I be plan on buy another one to hold my tow strap !
Bag	POS	5	I buy this sander sight unseen . I be look for something that be lightweight and could be use for more than just floor . the 1274dv 6.6 amp belt sander be well make , affordable , and best of all rectangular and flat side so that it can clamp or lie on its back as a fix sander . I have have no need to make any adjustment to the belt . the dust exhaust adapter do not fit my ShopVac small hose wand , be a little too small inside diameter , but the hose itself fit over the exhaust port and work extremely well , virtually no dust . I can not speak for commercial application , but for the typical home workshop , you simply can not go wrong . I buy the sander with the case , which I highly recommend . it will hold several belt and a small extension cord .
Bag	POS	5	I want a bag to carry my camera , a Canon s2 , my battery charger , battery and other equipment and also other thing like my wallet and cosmetic item so I decide on this item . the bag be very durable and sturdy . the weather protector look a bit silly but believe I , it work ! I have have it for over 5 month and I be very happy with it .
Bag	POS	5	I have be a hobby woodworker for nearly 30 year and I admit I may not be a expert in belt sander - for year I have suffer with smaller , cheaper model . when face with a very large , rough cut wood slab to finish , I make the investment . spend a lot of time look at model , review , etc and make the choice . it have prove wonderful in every way . this be a heavy , solid machine with plenty of power - use a 40 grit belt , it be still nearly impossible to slow down and in fact , little pressure be require . my arm feel it just try to keep it from run away . the dust collection be superb . it even seem to suck in dust lay on the workpiece next to the belt . Release of the roller tension be very nice and change the belt a breeze . Belt tracking adjustment be easy and it track perfectly . for a belt sander , it be very quiet - let I say that again in case you can not hear very well from use another model - incredibly quiet . the long power cord be a real bonus , no extension cord necessary . I be happy to add this machine to my shop .
Bag	POS	5	my Coleman Cable 08662 25-foot Heavy-Duty Booster Cables , 4-gauge fit in the bag with room for other car related tool . the bag be very well make . what a great combination . I highly recommend the Bucket Boss cord bag .
Bag	POS	5	I love these bag . they be provide at the condo community I live at and now that I have move out , I have to buy they myself . though a bit expensive , they be worth it . I notice that the quality be not as good as it be 2 year ago as they make the bag thinner now , but it be still better than the other bag with its 2-ply thickness where it count . I have only use the cheaper bag once since I adopt my dog 3 year ago so I do not have a real basis for comparison , but I think Mutt Mitts be worth the money . I be surprise after I find out how much they cost that it be provide for free -lrb- well , it be include in we maintenance fee -rrb- at the condo community I move out from .
Bag	POS	4	I be not a biker but buy the bag anyways , because I need a cool , handy bag to carry my PowerBook , PDA and load of other stash .  i find it very cool indeed and pleased that my PowerBook fit snugly inside . -lrb- at time I wonder if it be design for the PowerBook -rrb-  my only qualm be that the awkard top bit of the flap fold up when u carry it . I be sure that there could be a workaround .  other than that , I love the bag . it be brilliant and it be get Amazon.com on it ! yippeeee !
Bag	NEG	2	we order this bag when we order the Garrett ace 150 detector . I wish the bag be bigger . you need to take the detector apart every time you put it away . even shorten the detector the whole way be not enough . they could have make the bag just few inch longer and it would have make the difference .
Bag	NEU	3	while I agree with the other reviewer about the clean styling and ability to turn it upside down , I would have to disagree on the dustless and durability point . after use the sander for about two month the variable speed switch have to be replace because it would no longer work . also , because the opening use to gather the dust be very thin . therefore , when you work with fibrous material , it clog very frequently . I would also like it more if it have a little more weight to it so that with very hard wood you do not have to press down . but , this can obviously work against you with the softer variety .
Bag	POS	4	this bag be a great value . it be perfect for tight area in all car or truck . Works well and be compact .
Bag	POS	5	as other have mention this bag hold a lot of gear . one of the biggest selling point for I be that be that be can be use as you second carryon on a airline . as big as it be , it be design to fit under the seat , so it count as you hand hold carry on . I have travel with it many time and never have to gate check it . it be a little tight on the commuter plane , but I have always be able to carry it on to the plane with I . generally I have two camera body and a assortment of lens , flash etc. . it have separate compartment for extra flash card and battery as well as a few other pocket useful for battery charger , note book etc. .
Bag	POS	4	the Bosch belt sander be very powerful for it be size . I build a cabinet and use it to sand the wood , very fast sand smooth out the panel perfectly . I also have patch up my ceiling and it be uneven , this sander do pretty quick work of smooth it out . the only issue I have with it be the sand belt that come with it do not seem to stay evenly place on the roller . I can adjust it but it never sit the way it show in the manual . the belt always go outwards toward the belt release lever . I be go to use this belt up and then try the 3M one I purchase , hopefully these belt be better . but overall I be pleased .
Bag	POS	5	I have a Tamrac bag that give good service for a number of year and want a larger bag . I investigate Tamrac bag at they website to be able to make comparison between product . this camera bag have plenty of space and be very well make . I do miss the opening in the old bag that could hold my 8x10 gray card , a notebook and my camera manual the partion inside be form to support you camera with lens mount and you can customize since everything be anchor with velcor strip . the bag seem very durable , and be very roomy as this be one of they larger bag . Quality at a reasonable price . : -rrb-
Bag	POS	5	I recommend this bag for anyone want protection and versatility . it fit extra item such as some cash and dl and debit card easily so on a small excursion , I do not need to carry anything else . Perfect fit for my slightly odd shaped Cannon too .
Bag	POS	5	although a seam fail shortly after start use of this toolbag , I think it be a anomaly because I have a GateMouth Longboy that have endure a lot of hard use and the replacement Jr. bag be hold up just fine . both bag be light-weight but very strong and easy to carry . I do use the pocket sew into the bag but find that a couple of inexpensive office supply store pencil box work well to orgainize and protect my smaller tool and supplies . the GateMouth line of tool bag be very good quality and I recommend it highly .
Bag	POS	4	I need a bag for my Olympus e-300 with the lens kit . and this bag do its job quite good ... they be protective and it be get few pocket around which be quite useful . I just wish if the height be lil more . with this bag I can only have both the wideangle & telephoto lens if the wideangle be fit on to the camera -lrb- not the telephoto lens -rrb- .
Bag	POS	4	just what I hope it would be . fit my heavy gauge -lrb- 10g ? x 14ft -rrb- with a little room to spare .
Bag	POS	5	sander arrive in perfect condition . the belt that come with the sander should go straight into the garbage can ! once I put a good belt on , it be very simple to adjust the tracking , and it have hold that adjustment with no issue so far . the dust bag be ok , but it can get in the way on some project . the long cord be terrific , but be careful not to let it get in the way while you be sand . noise level be pretty decent . the sander perform very well , with no tendency to gouge the workpiece . all in all , I be totally please so far .
Bag	POS	4	this camera bag be really great . really the only reason I do not give it 5 star be because it be actually a little too big . I can fit my digital camera and my video camera -lrb- and it be not even one of those new tiny one -rrb- and still have plenty of room for extra bag and card and cord , etc. . it be really great for tote it all , but if you be try to go with the bare essential , this be certainly not the bag for you .
Bag	POS	4	Sands as expect : fast and easy to control . dust collection work ok . need to blow the system out with compress air to clear a blockage , once in 2 hour of sand . I order the Bosch sa1051 sand frame to go along with this purchase . unfortunately the seller of the frame , MaxTool , not only do not have item in stock -lrb- even though they clearly specify they do have -rrb- they be not able to get one within a two week period after my order . I cancel this order .
Bag	POS	5	I have a old Craftsman belt sander before and it do not have a dust bag . it make a mess all over my workshop . I have read in several magazine about dust bag on belt sander and many of they do not do what they be suppose to do . I read the 15 review on the Amazon site and they all claim this Makita be the best . I be totally satisfy . it surely do a exceptional job at keep the saw dust in the bag .
Bag	NEU	3	for year , I carry my Canon REBEL in a flimsy camera bag and decide to upgrade to a sturdier Samsonite bag after certain feature stop function and the lens break -lrb- 35mm-28mm -rrb- due to the lack of padding and shock resistance . -lrb- I also decide to get another Samsonite Worldproof because I previously purchase a Samsonite worldproof 4.1 for a 8mm video recorder and be very happy with it . -rrb- this bag be great for my camera , although I wish there be just a bit more compartment space to store my extra film in a more protected manner , rather than the side mesh pocket . furthermore , although this house the camera decently and there be adjustable cell , I wish there be more room to allow the camera to fit in more deeply so that the camera strap can fit without have to stuff it in . there be a inside mesh\/zip\/pocket on the lid , and you can use that to store something small and\/or slim . what I will enjoy most of all be the fact that this bag be very sturdy and dirt resistant , and will be a more attractive camera case to carry . although not too ample in space , this be a good bag overall .
Bag	POS	4	the Case Logic DC70 Digital Camera and Accessory Bag be great for Olympus C-3000 , c-3040 , c-3030 and the HP c315 xi and a couple of other HP and Olympus model . however it be not big enough to room the Sony Mavicas . so dont bother get this for those .  I do have a problem with this bag and that be that it seem like the accessory on there be really stuff once you camera be place inside it . because the camera come with the usb Cable and the tv connection cable and it be hard to pack all of they in here with the camera without stuff they in ...  there be place for a battery recharger in there and a set of battery along with the compact flash card . overall this case be pretty decent although you have get to be careful not to let the case swing about from you arm and hit a wall or something . there be other website sell this a little cheaper .
Bag	POS	5	this produce exceed my expectation . 1 -rrb- powerful 2 -rrb- very effective dust collection 3 -rrb- much quieter than I expect 4 -rrb- Easy to change belt 5 -rrb- sand belt stay on track I be very happy with this tool . this be simply one of the best tool I own . it help I with my bathroom remodel project in way I do not expect .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase this bag base on Amazon consumer recommendation and they be spot on ! excellent bag-hold everything , very secure . nice look as well and well design . very happy with it .
Bag	POS	5	I be completely excite to see this bag for sale on -lrb- ... -rrb- . I buy this same bag 8 year ago when I be commute to a cabinet shop for work . I be able to fit all of my hand tool into this seemingly little bag . it be amazing how much stuff I have be able to stuff into it ! I have be use it for a solid 8-year now with no let up in use . it have travel around the country with I tote my tool . I always over stuff it and it never complain . most of the time , it be gaping open for easy access . but if I need to close it , the heavy zipper always work . this thing be bomb proof . well , not quite , but after what I have put it through , I would rate it the best darn bag I have ever see or use . it be only problem for the manufacturer be that it be too well make . after 8 year , I do not need another one . I might just buy one now so I have a second on hand . buy this bag , you 'll love it .
Bag	POS	5	for the price , this product be great . it collect 80-90 % of the sawdust and be easy to empty . what more could you ask for ?
Bag	POS	4	buy this for my rigid table saw , would work with any saw with a 2 '' exhaust port . do not collect all the sawdust but I do not expect it to do so . probably get about 80-90 % . stop a lot of the airborne fine debris and keep anything else that escape pretty centrally located under the saw . if you can not use a vacuum , this be a very good alternative .
Bag	POS	5	I need a new gear bag to hold my new d-slr , and the lens I buy for it . the bag hold : d-slr -lrb- Pentax k2000 -rrb- 1 18-55mm 1 50-250 zoom 1 28-80mm 1 75-300 zoom Extra filter . battery . ton of digital memory card . Pentax Optio P&S; , with its charger all cable to be use w\/my laptop . sunglass . GPS Cell phone , if need there be lot of pocket that can hold a lot more stuff . I like it because it have like a double-protection security system , where everything be securely fasten with velcro strap and extra connector . I actually buy two because I be collect more lens for my camera . I be very satisfied with this gear bag . I think it offer a very secure way to stow you precious camera stuff .
Bag	POS	5	before I retire , I use one of these in my job for many year . the material for the bag be super-tough Cordura nylon . externally , the many different size pocket neatly store the most used tool for quick access , while internally , the bag have more vary size pocket on both side and on the end , keep all the tool require by electrical or mechanical tech organize and neat for ready access . the size of the bag be just right , IMO , for technician keep mechanical and electrical system in good work order . meter and other misc tool go in the center of the bag , and it be not heavy at all when fill . this bag become standard issue for all the other tech in the plant , it be fit and function perfect for we job . Quality be top notch . so it stand to reason that when I retire , I buy a new one for home use , it be a attachment I can not do without . there be a smaller one , but it be too small for the various tool and meter require by electromechanical technician , and the next size up , while have the same organizational attribute , become too heavy and bulky for people walk to problem in a manufacturing environment . it be the perfect size in we opinion .
Bag	NEG	2	I be surprise when this arrive completely empty . I read the description as Cable and tool bag , think that I be get cable and tool in a bag . no - just the bag . a bit overpriced for just a bag .
Bag	POS	5	very well design and manufacture machine . balance be near perfect , and use with one hand be comfortable and always in control . compare to a similar design sander , make by AEG , this sander be much more comfortable and better balanced . if you be a serious woodworker , this belt sander will spoil you . once you use this sander , you will not want to use a sander with a different design again .
Bag	POS	4	we love this to keep we jumper in and easy to find , and store in the truck .
Bag	POS	5	I buy the large for home and the small to keep in the car . both great bag .
Bag	POS	5	this sander be use to prepare a very large table top for my family that be make from old 8\/4x 10 ' oak . my exist wookworking equipment be not large enough for this size of lumber so I use the Makita to flatten and square the piece for assembly . it do the job I expect .
Bag	POS	5	this be the piece I be miss for my tablesaw . Works as design . nothing fancy , but do the trick !
Bag	POS	5	it probably be even more useful for a contractor ; but even for diy'er like I it save a lot of time to have all the screw , nail , bit , etc you may need at the work place and not have to run back to the shop\/garage whenever you need something not in you nail bag . it also allow you to separate they for easy identification and access . I buy two different configuration and use they routinely .
Bag	POS	5	this case be great . it fit my Canon s30 perfectly . the Tamrac 5694 case be recommend for the Canon s30 but that be really the wrong case for the Canon s30 because it be way too big . Case Logic CPS40 Koskin be really the perfect case . it fit the camera just right . the case be small and compact . it fit the camera snugly but leave just enough room to fit a media card and lens cloth . no , this case do not have any pocket or fancy compartment but in my opinion this would make the case too bulky . this case have a convenient belt loop instead a shoulder strap or strap that fit around the neck . I think the belt loop be much more practical . you do not have to worry about mistakingly leave the bag somewhere or lug it around . all and all this be a great case not just for canon but for any compact digital camera . plus the price be excellent .
Bag	POS	5	I work for year use a inexpensive belt sander with no dust collection system to speak of , at the time none have these . I want something a bit larger and test several newer model out . I find myself with a ryobus in similar design as the bosch . it be fine and I truely enjoy the balance . then I have a issue with the speed control get hot and soon it quit and off the find another brand . this time it be makita and a rather large 3 x 24 inch belt with one speed . yes it be powerful and heavy , most of the time I feel I would surely destroy anything and everything it come in contact with , one moment hesistation or lack of concentration and you find yourself with a deep grove because it tip . unbalanced side set motor , some people like these , I do not . I be all for learn to control and use a tool but I do not stand for a tool with a build in project distruct mechanism . Porter cable have a old time still in production inline giant that work very well , my father have one , just do not plug it in when on it be foot trigger lock on , face a double pane glass picture window . there be no stop it and yes it do perform a nice mid air drive very slightly slow by the force penetration of shattered glass . I leave this Makita sander for the job that need alot of fast stock removal , perhape if I be refinish a ship deck this would be the tool of choice . I be inform by the tool dealer in town this be the best sander around and it have be around for a good long time . I want a belt sander to smooth edge and a small to large surface with confidence that be all , nothing that want to drag I across the work suface at the flip of a switch . this be where the bosch come in , light and balanced , quiet and smooth , you be now in control not the tool . yes as someone else say the dust bag be not the one picture on the box , out of curiousity I phone bosch and it be politily express they have issue with static electical discharge that some people use the sander do not understand , some people must have forget simple science concept and think they be be electrically shock with a high voltage . never the less the bosch do send I one of the original bag along with it be fitting and I must say the new square bag be better . you can empty it very simply by put a shop vac nozzle to the plastic bag port and suck the contents out and even if you want to do the job right shake the bag and all come clean . no need to play with the plastic closure clip . this sander do what it be design for very very well indeed . light continue work with easily control stock removable for the finish of a fine wood project that possess flat side , not for what some find it for , clear away year of warp and splinter on some rough fashion sun deck that can comfortably seat 120 guest . for this type of industrial endevor get the big one , that be what they function be in life . if you be look for a belt sander for fine furnature work or do other work require precision and control and have always stay clear do to the fear of belt sander then the bosch be without question the one , for you ! in closing , this belt sander do last and hold up very well , I have have not one single problem with mine , it have do alot of time save work with I .
Bag	POS	4	good product , have 1 before . the only prblem be the 4inch cut in the canvas on the bottom of the bag . look like a razor cut . could of happen in shipping . bring the bag to a local shoe repairman and have a piece of leather glue and sewd to the bottom of the bag . be go to have this do any way , because the only down fall to this product be that the bottom wear away in about a year and ahalf and hole start to appear around the conner and at the base of the screw driver holeder . beside that as a a\/c repair man the bag work well and other bag on the market do not have all the pocket and screwdiver holeder on the inside . in short iwould buy this product agian .
Bag	POS	4	the Kodak bag be a nice lightweight bag that be easy to carry . I do wish that I could load my digital camcorder vertical instead of sit it horizontal . the bag would need to be a little taller for I to give it five star . it would allow I to carry my camcorder as well as my camera at the same time without sit they on top of one another . overall it be a very nice bag .
Bag	POS	5	I have now purchase 2 box of these bag . they do not rip and be very sturdy . I have a large dog and these bag work great .
Bag	POS	4	I be a hobby woodworker and just start to add to my tool collection . this be my fist belt sander and I while I do not have experience with any other sander -lrb- other than a dewault that a friend lend I to scribe a counter top in my laundry room - and it seem to work well -rrb- , I believe the Makita live up to its stellar reputation . everything just seem to work flawlessly . once you have belt adjust , it track perfectly . I understand this be the one issue that most user concern themselves with and I can not speak any more highly about it . track straight and true for sure . I be delighted with my purchase but only give it four star because for $ 200 I think it should come with a bag or case . other than that , this be a very high quality tool .
Bag	POS	5	I be a serious amateur photographer and need a base camp for all of my photography goody . this bag allow I to keep everything together and I pull from there whatever I need for whatever shoot I plan on do that day . it have ton of pocket and all of my 5 lens , filter , and lot of other stuff fit in there nicely . it close quite securely and be well padded . love it .
Bag	POS	5	just get my messenger bag and load the laptop and other `` essential '' stuff in it . I like it . quality construction and material . Enough pocket for stuff that need pocket . I , too , would like the other side of the laptop compartment pad . a divider inside the bag would be nice too . but those be nit . it be the best reasonably price messenger bag I have see .
Bag	POS	5	buy two of THESE BAGS for CHRISTMAS gift . both love the bag , one man be 52 and the other 25 . so great gift for any age .
Bag	POS	5	I use this bag to house my Dewalt D51822 clip Head Framing nailer . other have complain about how they nailer fit in this bag , but my Dewalt fit great with a little room to spare . the material be strong and do not seem like it will rip , tear , or fray easily . the zipper and other hardware ar extremely tough and will probably last a life time . the bottom of the bag be semi-rigid and offer extra protection when it be place on the ground .
Bag	POS	5	this be one thing I think be not really need but maybe nice to have . once I start use it I be amaze that it be so handy to have . screw be easy to get to , I dont have to fumble around with box , I can keep nut close to the bolt they fit . I 'll need some more of these soon
Bag	POS	4	I buy this bag when I first start photograph as a hobby . it have be with I since , through the muck and filth , and have manage to protect all my equipment from the element without fail . it have plenty of space for a reasonable amount of equipment . Mine be stock with a Canon 35mm -lrb- with lens attach -rrb- , a wide angle lens , tele-zoom lens , flash , filter , and all my cleaning tool . I have not have any of the problem mention about some other bag -lrb- leak , rip , fabric knotting , zipper fail -rrb- . although I be move up to more and larger equipment , this will always be my casual shooter bag !  the only qualm I have with this bag be the shoulder strap . the strap be just a plain nylon strap with no slip prevention or shoulder padding . I believe that Samsonite might have consider -lrb- with the large capacity of this bag -rrb- provide a non-slip padded cover for the strap . long trek yield a lot of pull the bag back up on you shoulder and painful welt . thus the 4 star .
Bag	POS	4	great bag . well make . it be easy to carry cause not too wide . use it for garden tool . could be improve with little more length to accommodate longer tool -lrb- long bag be too long -rrb- . also , softer handle and no pocket on the end of inside .
Bag	NEU	3	Makita 9403 belt sander be a excellent product but my machine arrive with a few issue that buyer should look for . the plastic slide that hold the dust bag -lrb- part no. 1225629 -rrb- close come break in several place and the screw m6x25 -lrb- part no. 251815-0 -rrb- use in align the sand belt also come bent -lrb- due to poor packaging -rrb- . I be able to align the belt use a channel lock on the screw but I should have return the sander if it be not for the fact that I need the sander for a home project that come weekend no time to return it and get a new one in its place . I decide to order a new screw for the sander at $ 9 with shipping and a make myself a new clip for the dust bag from stuff around the house . the sander overall be a quality product but just watch out for these potential issue . this be the reason for my rating .
Bag	NEG	2	I take a lot of photography trip on weekend . one thing I like to do be to leave my 70-200mm or 100-400mm lens attach to the camera , on top of the photo bag in the passenger seat of the truck while I drive in rural area . if I see something of interest , I stop the truck grab the camera , get out and take some image . that be what attract I to this product . the issue with this bag be that if you have a lens with a lens hood , the lens will not fit in the compartment of the bag , and still be functional as be advertise -lrb- and as I describe above -rrb- . I have a 24-70 with lens hood , a 16-35 with lens hood , a 70-200 with lens hood , a 100-400 with lens hood , a 100mm macro with lens hood , etc. . these lens do not fit in the bag , with the hood invert , if you want to carry you camera across the top as picture . I try to make it work , and end up return the bag .
Bag	NEU	3	this bag really work great for the camera with strap , a battery or two and a memory card . that be it though do not plan on put you car key or cell phone in too it just will not work . just the camera and that be about it . but , remember it be a camera bag !
Bag	POS	5	just the right size for carry household tool from closet to where they be need . I like that it zip up and have pocket on the inside and outside . it even have a padded shoulder strap . Update 11\/2008 : I agree that thing do tend to fall out of the interior pocket . divider would make this more useful for organize small item . still give this 5 star for durability . for small tool , I now use a couple large shallow box -lrb- picture frame come in they -rrb- . keep stack in a drawer , I can more quickly see the tool I need or take the whole box to a project site .
Bag	POS	5	my husband and I use these for we dog . they be wonderful and keep hand clean . the double layer at the bottom be really nice .
Bag	POS	5	let start by say this be a powerful machine that do exactly what it be suppose to do . say that let talk about the mishap I encounter . I have 5 bird Eye maple glue up panel that I be have problem with tear out so I decide to purchase this item . all arrive on time and in perfect condition -lrb- unit have some sawdust on it as Makita always test they unit before packaging -rrb- . anyway after I open the box I immediately bring it to the shop , it come with a 80 grit belt and I feel this would be a good start point . I plug it in and turn it over to adjust the tracking and be rest it on my hip with one hand and reach for the tracking knob with the other and my sweatshirt get too close , touch the sandpaper and be immediately suck behind the belt . anyway , it happen so quick it start at the hip and run all the way up to my neck before I be able to let go of the power switch . luckily it stop before it get to my face . I have to cut off the sweatshirt and it take a hour and several cutting before I get it clear . this be one powerful well build machine as nothing happen to it , but it destroy my sweatshirt . after I get everything put back together I bring it to the shop and within 5 minute I have a perfectly flat panel ready for the random orbit sand to the fine grits . I would definitely recommend this to anyone , but do not wear loose clothing near it . I be fortunate that I be not at the table saw - a Sawstop in my future perhaps !
Bag	POS	5	I stop use my Crapsman belt sander a long time ago . it be more work than it be worth . when I run into a particularly difficult wood that even my Lie-Nielsen plane , at the highest angle and with the sharpest blade iron , could not plane without chip out , I have only two option : scraper or a belt sander . because of the amount I have to remove , I choose the belt sander . so I break down and buy a real belt sander . and now I be wonder what take em so long . while a bit heavy , it work like a charm ! and it be so fast I wish I have more project that require a belt sander . it track well . it be easy to set down on the wood without gouge it . dust collection be excellent . it be relatively quiet . change belt be easy . and it do not bog down under load .
Bag	NEG	2	not worth the price you ask ? it be only $ 11.00 . true . do not waste you $ 11.00 . instead plug a shop vac into the exhaust port of the table saw . the small exhaust port get jam easily and if that happen , forget collect any dust in the bag . if the exhaust port stay clear , then I would say I collect about 10 % of the dust produce . especially with mdf . what a mess !! I build a moble stand for the saw and folding stand so I push the whole thing out into the drive way and use it out there because of the mess it make inside the garage .  the saw be great and I be very happy with it . I give it 4 or 5 five star in my review of the saw itself . but this collection bag be pointless . save you money and spend it elsewhere .  until I get my dust collector for all my tool , I use this bag on my DeWalt 2-speed planer where it work great . I empty it frequently , but that be a planer for you .
Bag	POS	4	I agree with a previous reviewer that the dust collection system be poor . Mine keep come off and frankly , it get in the way . I beleive I have come up with a good solution . I have a porter-cable finish sander # 333v and it have a unique dust collection system . call a sand trap , it be a porus cup that work quite well , collect even the finest sanding . I purchase a spare cup for -lrb- $ $ $ -rrb- and mount it on the 1274 with a 1 inch piece of plastic tubing and a clamp . it seem to work perfectly . I 'll advise after I use it a month or so . you can buy the sand trap from Porter Cable direct by call technical service list on they web site .
Bag	POS	5	very nice sander . variable speed , very stable belt tracking , quiet . only negative be that it do not come with its own case , and for the price it really should . these belt dander get pretty dirty , and for outside job extra belt be often need so a case would be nice . the belt tracking need only a initial adjustment for the first belt - very nice . it appear quite well build .
Bag	POS	5	Works great and construct well . my jumper cable coil up inside nicely and be no longer a tangled mess on the floor of my truck . it fit behind the seat next to my Bucket Boss Tool Roll -lrb- another problem solver -rrb- where I keep my tool set .
Bag	POS	5	I spend the last few day buy sander and take they back -lrb- 2 actually -rrb- . one be a porter and cable 3x21 . this seem to be a well build sander except the dust collection system be very flaw . I have more dust fly than go into the bag . then I get the heavy duty DeWalt . this be a heavy brute . I find the top front wheel create a vibration every so often that the sander seem to hop and create tiger stripe on the work . it also require a lot of energy bto hold it down . even tghough the dust collector seem to be one of the best , I find a lot of dust all over the bag . I do not know if the bag fabric 's hole be allow the dust to escape or create static electricity to attract dust . even though the bag collect the dust , it seem the sander blow a whole heap of dust around . when in a tight corner and I tip the front to extend the reach , it seem to bite the work . it seem to go through a lot of sand belt with little to show for it . then I buy this baby . . very light and require very little effort to hold it on the work -lrb- always fight with the DeWalt -rrb- . the way this be design , there seem to be very little dust outside the bag and even then , there be no vent hole to blow it all around . the collection system work great and there be even a little attachment so I can hook up a shop-vap with a small hose . the sand belt seem to last twice as long as the DeWalt -lrb- do not know why this be so -rrb- . the sand seem to be far more efficient than the other sander I try and return . the icing on the cake be a accessory to hold the sander like a table sander .
Bag	POS	5	I have be use the dust bag for a week now and it work . be it a dust elimination system , no. . but it do cut down on my clean up by 95 % . not bad for a $ 13 item . I could not see run my table see without it .
Bag	POS	5	we have be use this product for year and love the convenience and efficiency of this item . the heavy plastic protect you hand , and the bag size be large enough that you can tie a knot in the end to seal the bag until it be dispose in a garbage receptacle . pick up after you pet be quick and easy with Mutt Mitts .
Bag	POS	4	lowepro do it again . be a former photo-journalist for the magazine `` Ebony , '' I always have to be on the run with my camera , and have to be ready . Lowepro have always be a reliable , affordable , attractive producer of bag , and the Nova Mini be no exception . if you only have a small camera with little film , get it ! I be tell you , especially when you do not want to be lug around a camera bag the size of a suitcase -lrb- trust I , take a plane and argue with the flight attendant if you bag be too big or not to have to put into storage be a hassle and a half ! -rrb- . Lowepro ... a name you can trust !
Bag	POS	5	when I first receive this case , the sheer size of the packaging throw I off - feel like it be another piece of check-in luggage ! however , have use it for a few week for my slr -lrb- Nikon D-80 -rrb- , the case actually do a perfect job of protect the camera , lens , and other accessory . any smaller and I think it would have be non-functional for my camera . the availability of pocket pretty much all over help store accessory . overall I really like this case and I know my camera and lens be secure in it .
Bag	POS	5	a great bag for a small-mid size digital camera . I have the Olympus d-490 zoom and it fit perfectly . the additional pouch hold my extra battery and memory card safely . Pretty sturdy construction and well padded for any accidental bump the camera may take . it be well make and you have a choice of wear the bag on you belt or use the shoulder strap . Compact and look great .
Bag	POS	5	I would recommend these bag because they be easy to use and seem very sanitary . I only thing I would suggest be a small pocket or container to keep they in while walk .
Bag	NEU	3	a decent light-duty sander for the price , it have some problem but also some nice feature . I like that the sander hit the right mark on weight . I do not have to press on it at all , nor should one press on a belt sander anyway . I like that it have a 6-foot long power cord . that be about 3 foot longer than on most power tool these day . I like that I can turn the sander upside-down , a very nice feature . Belt change be simple as be adjust the belt tracking . there be attachment which can be purchase to enhance the upside-down experience . they be ridiculously expensive . a crafty person can improvise this with various shop equipment -lrb- think clamp -rrb- , thanks to the sander 's flat top . why do I need to use a tool to remove the front handle ? the graphite pad , supposedly a feature , self-destruct quickly . seriously , that pad need replacement after every hour of sand . it be the worst aspect of this sander . if you buy this sander , get some pad because you will need they . if you only run the machine for a few minute at a time , and the pad have a few more minute to cool between use , you might get better result . the wobbly variable speed dial feel cheap . I be not sure it will last long enough to go out of warranty . it take some head-scratching and read to understand how that dial work . it be not very well marked and it be confuse to find which mark the hard-to-read number be suppose to be set against . as it turn out in use , the number mean little since the sander 's speed only vary within the just-short-of-fast to way-too-fast range . I use the sander with my Shop-Vac attach so I can not speak for the bag attachment . I be assume it be a upgrade version since it be nothing like the bag show in the product photo . with my Shop-Vac , it seem all the dust be suck up so I do like that . I do notice that the instruction address a different type of dust bag and fitting than be provide with the sander . not a big deal , but it make one wonder why Bosch can not be bother to update they literature . I like the sander . it will work for I as a light duty machine . just keep you eye on that pad .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be everthe it be advertise to be . . very secure , lot of compartment and well build . I recommend this bag whole heartedly .
Bag	POS	5	great video bag . Interior have a nice divder for store cam on one side and supplies , tape , power pack on the other . have a cool front pocket for those of we that always need a \* little \* more room for store something .  the whole bag seem to absorb shock with the foam-like padding . I also like the lid which hang over a little so thing dont fall out and dirt do not get in .
Bag	POS	4	this be a excellent bag for hiker or cyclist who want to travel light but wish to be able to bring along a minus camcoder or camera for those photo moment . the compartment be big enough to hold you camcorder , spare battery and a few filter for you camcorder .
Bag	NEU	3	the bag be easy to install , but only collect about 50 % of the dust collect . a shop vac might do better , but not too much better .
Bag	POS	5	my  Coleman Cable 08862 25-foot Ultra-Heavy-Duty Truck and Auto Battery Booster Cables , 2-gauge  I 'll admit it , it be a snug fit and you have to roll up you cable nice and neat to get they to fit and there be not much room leave over . there be zero room leave over with large jumper cable in the bag . the only thing I have in there be the jumper cable and a laminated large print 8.5 x11 instruction sheet on how to use they . that say , if you can get my 25 foot , 2gauge jumper cable into this bag , you can probably fit almost any other set of jumper cable into this bag . the bag be well construct , with nice zipper and good sturdy handle . it really make lug around jumper cable a tidy affair . I highly recommend you have a bag like this for you jumper cable , particularly if you cable be large for a variety of reason : a -rrb- keep they neat b -rrb- make more room for other stuff c -rrb- keep the insulation of cable from get rough up d -rrb- one tidy package if you need to grab it and walk I can not find many con to this bag . it be nice and the price be right too !
Bag	POS	5	the ergonomics of this bag fit everyone 's need the pouch hold everything video . this be great !
Bag	POS	5	I have own about 12 toolbag in the past 5 year . my Bucket Boss junior -lrb- smaller -rrb- size be a great bag , and for a larger bag I have own several different manufacturer . however , I want to consolidate my tool and go look for a larger Bucket Boss . I be thrill to have find this one . this bag be sturdy , with great outside pocket and a lot of inside pocket too . I jam my tool in there stand up ... on the wall of the bag ... like a needle nose , screwdriver , and chisel , and the bag have not rip nor tear . the handle be a big padded to make carry it easier too . every other bag I have have have have some drawback - one thing that make it suboptimal . this bag truly have it all and I hope they be still make they in 20 year which be how long I think it 'll be before I need to replace it . the only 1 thing I would recommend be that they rivet some small metal `` foot '' onto the bottom of the bag , to rise it about a quarter or half inch off the ground , so that if you set it down on wet or dirty ground , the bottom will not get wet . PS - it be large enough to hold basically every tool I need for a household job , include a 16v drill and case of drill bit .
Bag	POS	4	I purchase this after read review post and see where the Bostitch n-88 would fit in this bag , it do but its a little tight . the bag be of very nice quality and have a very heavy duty zipper . it come with a shoulder strap and two handle to carry by hand -lrb- I be surprised it do not have the velcro strap that will keep the handle togeather . the picture be a little misleading though , from the picture it look as if it have a stiff bottom and wil sit upright , well I be here to tell you it wont ! I think the photographer fill the bag with lightweight foam when this picture be take , not a frame gun . all and all I be happy with it , I just wish it be a tad bigger and the bottom be more riggid .
Bag	POS	5	I order these for all of the Supervisor vehicle in use by we emergency medical service . after seven year they be still in great shape . the one that I order from Amazon be a personal purchase for myself . I know that it will do the job and last a long time .
Bag	POS	5	this bag be very well make and be a good size . some of the pocket on the inside could be a little larger , or maybe a divider could have be add , but overall most people will really like the amount of stuff that you can pack in this bag .
Bag	NEU	3	I buy this bag think that I could get my 40d with a 28-70mm zoom mount -lrb- with lens hood -rrb- and then my other 3 lens into the bag . it turn out I could not include my 170-500 Sigma lens . I put it back in its original bag and hook that bag to this bag . I have to take out just about all of the divider as they come . I be able to get my camera with the lens -lrb- no hood -rrb- and the battery grip into the bag , my 70-200 canon l lens , my flash and my 100mm macro Sigma lens into the main compartment . the three lens hood be all just lay on top . the other pocket and such be fine . I be just very disappointed with the room of the bag inside . I think from now on I will have to go to a brick and mortar store to see the product and buy it there .
Bag	NEG	2	I be hope for something that would hold the jumper cable compactly , but this bag be much bigger than need be . and it do not look like the picture . I think I 'll return it for those reason .
Bag	NEG	2	too small
Bag	POS	5	what a great buy ! this bag work great for either a digital still camera or mini camcorder . I purchase the Lowepro 40aw after research they on the internet and check out the lowepro site . I originally buy the 40 aw to use with my Toshiba PDR M-5 Digital still Camera . I could fit either the still camera and all the accessory -- cable , filter , you name it , or my Canon zr10 with \* almost \* all the gear . but I love it so much I buy this bag too -- Lowepro Digital beltpack AW -- for the zr10 . they be high quality camera bag and the Digital variety come with a special lining that will not scratch sensitive lcd screen ! lot of extra little pocket for tape , smart card , cable , and charger too . the outside be soft yet rugged and well construct . I think my high dollar digital camera investment feel safe and sound in this great camera bag !
Bag	POS	4	the shipment be receive in time and be nicely pack . this be a good bag and be small . the build quality be good and I use this to carry tool when I go for long drive . overall the bag be good but when I check similar bag in store those be little less price with similar quality as compare to this . but overall it be a good bag .
Bag	POS	5	-lrb- this be a update to the review I post below . after several month of use , I be have a problem with the waste port ... the path that clear the dust from the surface to the bag . basically , it be get clogged and while this do not prevent the sander from work , it do prevent dust collection . clean the port be a pain , I have to disassemble the motor cover and use a very small screwdriver to push the clog out . -rrb-  i really like this sander , but I can not comment on long term durability as I have only use it for about a month . nonetheless , Bosch 's reputation for build high quality power tool be pretty solid .  the belt alignment on this be pretty much maintenance free , I have not have to adjust it yet . the overall design be outstanding , easy to use with one hand when you need to , and have good grip for when you need to bear down .  the other aspect of the design that be top be that you can easily get into tight spot . the motor housing do not extend past the right side of the sander . the variable speed switch be nice , and it have a wheel to modulate the top speed -lrb- a higher speed would be nice , I think this be 1,400 feet\/sec -rrb- .  the sander really be `` almost dust free '' , just depend on what you be sand . the dust bag be the only negative , it be small and need to be empty a lot . but after look at it , it probably would not be a big deal to retrofit another bag .  Bosch 's 4x24 sander be also really nice , but it weigh 14 lb . the 3x21 sander be perfect for most job .
Bag	POS	5	I purchase the Makita 9903 belt sander to remove paint from my home that I be repaint . I be totally happy with my purchase . the variable speed control and the belt tracking be perfect . I have a old Sears belt sander that do not compare to the Makita .
Bag	NEU	3	it be realy a nice bag however it to small for every thing to fit in if you have load of accesory to fit in
Bag	POS	5	this be a sturdy bag that be huge ! I buy it for long tool and this fit the bill . all construction be durable and the only plastic be the zipper-all other part be metal . six big pocket on the outside and 9 slit pocket on one side of the inside with divider -lrb- w\/velcro fastener -rrb- . great product that should be make in America .
Bag	POS	5	this be a great all around bag for the average ameture photographer . lot of room for a body and up to a 300 mm lens .
